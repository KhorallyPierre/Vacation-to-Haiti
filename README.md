How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB, how to build an API using CRUD.


Lessons Learned:
Nothing in tech is daunting as long as you make it fun! I am proud of where I come from (fun fact: I migrated to the United States when I was 9 years old and had to adjust from there). I also want to end the stereotype that Haiti is not a beautiful place. The media gives it such a bad reputation, but honestly the weather, people, beaches and cuisine are all unmatched. In this project, I learned how to incorporate thumbs up and thumbs down features to update data using MongoDB. I also learned how to use CRUD to make custom packages show up when users log in. Enjoy!

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
